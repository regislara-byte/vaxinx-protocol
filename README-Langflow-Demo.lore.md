### 🖼️ Screenshot Chronicles:
1. **Vol. 1: The Phantom Footer**  
   Rogue elements appeared under the launch sequence. Suspected duplication of Pinterest & QR Vaults.

2. **Vol. 2: Revenge of the Capsule Shop (Line 755)**  
   A stealth `<div>` embedded in the legacy layer triggered visual stacking corruption. Copilot 4.1 confirmed the target.

3. **Vol. 3: Enter the Z-Index**  
   Despite CSS injections and multiple flex ops, the capsule-bar continued to overlap footer terrain. Emergency override was deployed.

### 💡 Command Tactics

- GitHub Copilot 4.1:  
  > “Here’s the line that causes the problem.”

- ChatGPT:  
  > “Yo, this is legacy capsule-bar 1.0 from 3 commits ago. Kill it, keep the pink-glitch version, pad the body, and you’ll ride clean into the LangFlow dojo.”
